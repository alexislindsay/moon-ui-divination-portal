    "judgment": "THE CREATIVE works sublime success,   Furthering through perseverance.     Commentary on the Decision 3   NOTE. This commentary, no doubt correctly ascribed to Confucius, explains the names of the hexagrams as well as the words appended by King Wên to the hexagram as a whole [the Judgment]. In general, the commentary first explains the name of the hexagram, taking into consideration as occasion demands its character, its image, and its structure. Next it elucidates the words of King Wên, either using the sources just named or else starting from the situation of the ruler of the hexagram or from the change of form that has given rise to the hexagram.   No explanation of the names of the eight primary trigrams is given; because it is assumed that this is known.   In the Chinese, the sentences in this commentary are for the most part rhymed, probably in order to make it easier to remember them. The rhymes have not been reproduced in this translation, because they are of no material significance. However, it is well to remember the circumstance, because it explains much of the abruptness in the style, which is often somewhat forced.   Great indeed is the sublimity of the Creative, to which all beings owe their beginning and which permeates all heaven. 4   The commentary separates the two pairs of attributes given in the Judgment into the four individual attributes of the creative power, whose visible form is heaven. The first attribute is sublimity, which, as the primal cause of all that exists, forms the most important and most inclusive attribute of the Creative. The root meaning of the Chinese word for it— yüan —is literally “head.”   The clouds pass and the rain does its work, and all individual beings flow into their forms.     This explains the expression “success.” The success of the creative activity is revealed in the gift of water, which causes the germination and sprouting of all living things. The first passage tells of the beginning of all beings in general; here the separate species in their particular forms are instanced. These two passages show the attributes of greatness and success as they manifest themselves in the creative force in nature. The attributes of sublimity and success take shape correspondingly in the creative man, the sage, who is in harmony with the creative power of the godhead.   Because the holy man is clear as to the end and the beginning, as to the way in which each of the six stages completes itself in its own time, he mounts on them toward heaven as though on six dragons.   The holy man, who understands the mysteries of creation inherent in end and beginning, in death and life, in dissolution and growth, and who understands how these polar opposites condition one another, becomes superior to the limitations of the transitory. For him, the meaning of time is that in it the stages of growth can unfold in a clear sequence. He is mindful at every moment and uses the six stages of growth as if they were six dragons (the image attributed to the individual lines) on which he mounts toward heaven. This is the sublimity and success of the Creative as it shows itself in man.   The way of the Creative works through change and transformation, so that each thing receives its true nature and destiny and comes into permanent accord with Great Harmony: this is what furthers and what perseveres.   Here the two other attributes, power to further and power to persevere, are explained in their relation to the creative force in nature. The mode of the creative is not rest but continuous movement and development. Through this force, all things are gradually changed until they are completely transformed in their manifestation. Thus the seasons and all living beings change and alternate in their course. In this way each thing  receives the nature appropriate to it, which, from the divine viewpoint, is called its appointed destiny. This explains the concept of furthering. With each thing thus finding its mode, a great and lasting harmony arises in the world: this is expressed in the concept of perseverance (lastingness and integrity).   He towers high above the multitude of beings, and all lands are united in peace.   This describes the creative power of the holy man, who makes it possible for everything to attain its appropriate place, thus bringing about peace on earth, when he occupies an eminent ruling place.   In all these explanations there is an evident parallelism between the Creative in nature and the Creative in the world of man. What is said about the Creative in nature is based on the image of heaven symbolized by the hexagram. Heaven shows the strong, ceaseless movement that by its nature causes everything to happen in due time. The words about the Creative in man are based on the position of the ruler of the hexagram, the nine in the fifth place. The “flying dragon in the heavens” is the image of the sublimity and success of the holy ruler. The eminent place held by the holy man, through which peace comes to the world, has its basis in the line, “It furthers one to see the great man.”   Commentary on the Images 5   NOTE. This commentary, starting with the combination of the two trigrams, deduces from it the situation represented by the hexagram as a whole. With the attributes of the two trigrams as a basis, it then gives advice for correct behavior in this situation.",
    "image": "The movement of heaven is full of power.   Thus the superior man makes himself strong and untiring.   The doubling of the trigram Ch’ien, the Creative, gives the image of powerful and constantly repeated movement. The doubling suggests that one draws strength from within oneself, and that after each action a new one follows, without cease.",

The Creative does indeed guide all happenings, but it never becomes manifest; it never behaves outwardly as the leader. Thus true strength is that strength which, mobile as it is hidden, concentrates on the work without being outwardly visible. Since all the lines are nines, the hexagram Ch’ien changes into the hexagram, K’un, THE RECEPTIVE, which is wholly receptive; hence no head is showing.   Commentary on the Words of the Text 6   NOTE. This wing consists of four commentaries on the first two hexagrams in the Book of Changes. Of these, two commentaries deal with the text referring to the hexagram as a whole [the Judgment] and also with the  T’uan Chuan  [Commentary on the Decision], while all four also elucidate the individual lines. [The commentaries, here designated as  a ,  b ,  c , and  d , contain a different number of sections each.] In the original text the sequence is arranged as follows:  a , 1–9;  b , 1–7;  c , 1–7;  d , 1–12. In the presentation below, for the sake of clarity and to avoid unnecessary repetition, the different  commentaries pertaining to the respective hexagrams have been arranged together, and are distinguishable by the classifying letters and numerals.   On the Hexagram as a Whole   a) 1. Of all that is good, sublimity is supreme. Succeeding is the coming together of all that is beautiful. Furtherance is the agreement of all that is just. Perseverance is the foundation of all actions.   Here the four fundamental attributes of the hexagram are related to the four cardinal virtues of Chinese ethics. Sublimity is correlated with humaneness, success with the mores, furtherance with justice, and perseverance with wisdom. 7   a) 2. Because the superior man embodies humaneness, he is able to govern men. Because he brings about the harmonious working together of all that is beautiful, he is able to unite them through the mores. Because he furthers all beings, he is able to bring them into harmony through justice. Because he is persevering and firm, he is able to carry out all actions.   The four fundamental attributes of the Creative are likewise the attributes necessary to a leader and ruler of men. In order to rule and lead men, the first essential is to have humane feeling toward them. Without humaneness, nothing lasting can be accomplished in the sphere of authority. Power that influences through fear works only for the moment and necessarily arouses resistance as a countereffect.   On the basis of this conception, it follows that the mores are the instrument by which men can be brought into union. For nothing binds people more firmly together than deeply rooted social usages that are observed because they appear to each  member of society as something beautiful and worth striving for.   Wherever it is possible to construct a framework of mores in which each person feels content, it is easy to unify and organize the masses. Furthermore, as the foundation of social life there must be the greatest possible freedom and the greatest possible advantage for all. These are guaranteed by justice, which curtails individual freedom no more than is absolutely necessary for the general welfare. Finally, to reach the desired goals, there is the fourth requisite of wisdom, manifesting itself by pointing out the established and enduring paths that, according to immutable cosmic laws, must lead to success.   a ) 3. The superior man acts in accordance with these four virtues. Therefore it is said: The Creative is sublime, successful, furthering, persevering.   d ) 1. The sublimity of the Creative depends on the fact that it begins everything and has success.   d ) 2. Furtherance and perseverance: thus it brings about the nature and way of all beings.   Here the attributes are again summed up in pairs. The sublimity of the Creative depends on its absoluteness, on the fact that it is the beginning of all things—for it is not itself conditioned by anything else—and that it is the active principle, i.e., it is itself the cause of all else. Furtherance and perseverance—meaning the urge to life, and the fixed laws of nature—reveal the causality of the Creative in its efficacy. The urge to life—that which furthers and is right for each being—lays the foundation of its nature, and this nature acts according to fixed laws: this is the way of all beings. In the Commentary on the Decision nature is traced back to its origin in the divine decree; here nature is shown in its mode of action.   d ) 3. The Creative, by positing the beginning, is able to further the world with beauty. Its true greatness lies in the fact that nothing is said about the means by which it furthers.     Of the Creative it is said only that it furthers by virtue of what eternally belongs to it, by virtue of its very nature. This nature is not defined more exactly. In this lies the suggestion of the infinite possibilities and aspects of its benefits. The Receptive forms a contrast to this, because it is said: “It furthers through the perseverance of a mare.” In the phenomenal world, each thing has its specific nature: this is the principle of individuation. At the same time this specific nature fixes a boundary that separates each individual being from every other.   d ) 4. How great indeed is the Creative! It is firm and strong, moderate and correct, pure, unalloyed and spiritual.   Here the attributes of the whole hexagram are deduced from the nature of its ruler, the nine in the fifth place, as is frequently the case in the  T’uan Chuan , Commentary on the Decision, to which the entire passage refers. The fifth line is firm because it is in an uneven place, strong because it is undivided (strong means movement, firm means rest); it is moderate because it is in the middle of the upper trigram, correct because it stands in its appropriate place—a strong line in a strong place. In these four attributes the four cardinal attributes of the hexagram are revealed once more. These attributes are present in pure, unalloyed, and spiritual form because the hexagram consists of strong lines only.   d ) 5. The six individual lines open up and unfold the thought, so that the character of the whole is explained through its different sides.   Because of the unity of the hexagram, the individual lines stand in a continuous relationship that, as it progresses, clarifies the idea of the whole still further. In this respect the hexagram Ch’ien, THE CREATIVE, forms a contrast to K’un, THE RECEPTIVE, in which the single lines stand side by side without inner relationship. This inheres in the temporal character of THE CREATIVE as contrasted with the spatial character of THE RECEPTIVE.     d ) 6. “In his own time he mounts toward heaven on six dragons. The clouds pass and the rain falls.” All this means peace coming to the world.   Because of this closing remark, the corresponding passage in the Commentary on the Decision is interpreted as a reference to historical events, namely, the ordering of the empire.   On the Lines   On nine at the beginning:   a ) 4. Nine at the beginning means: “Hidden dragon. Do not act.” What does this signify? The Master said:   This means a person who has the character of a dragon but remains concealed. He does not change to suit the outside world; he makes no name for himself. He withdraws from the world, yet is not sad about it. He receives no recognition, yet is not sad about it. If lucky, he carries out his principles; if unlucky, he withdraws with them. Verily, he cannot be uprooted; he is a hidden dragon.   b ) 1. “Hidden dragon. Do not act.” The reason is that he is below.   c ) 1. “Hidden dragon. Do not act.” The power of the light principle is still covered up and concealed.   d ) 7. The superior man acts in accordance with the character that has become perfected within him. This is a way of life that can submit to scrutiny on any day.   Being hidden means that he is still in concealment and not given recognition, that if he should act he would not as yet accomplish anything. In this case the superior man does not act.     On nine in the second place:   a ) 5. Nine in the second place means: “Dragon appearing in the field. It furthers one to see the great man.” What does this signify?   The Master said: This means a man who has the character of a dragon and is moderate and correct. Even in ordinary speech he is reliable. Even in ordinary actions he is careful. He does away with what is false and preserves his integrity. He improves his era and does not boast about it. His character is influential and transforms men.   In the Book of Changes it is said: “Dragon appearing in the field. It furthers one to see the great man.” This refers to a man who has the qualities of a ruler.    b ) 2. “Dragon appearing in the field.” The reason is that he is not needed as yet.   c ) 2. “Dragon appearing in the field.” Through him the whole world attains beauty and clarity.   d ) 8. The superior man learns in order to gather material; he questions in order to sift it. Thus he becomes generous in nature and kindly in his actions.   In the Book of Changes it is said: “Dragon appearing in the field. It furthers one to see the great man.” For he has the qualities of a ruler.   On nine in the third place:   a ) 6. Nine in the third place means: “All day long the superior man is creatively active. At nightfall his mind is still beset with cares. Danger. No blame.” What does this signify?   The Master said: The superior man improves his character and labors at his task. It is through loyalty and faith that he fosters his character. By working  on his words, so that they rest firmly on truth, he makes his work enduring. He knows how this is to be achieved and achieves it; in this way he is able to plant the right seed. He knows how it is to be brought to completion and so completes it; thereby he is able to make it truly enduring. For this reason he is not proud in his superior position nor disappointed in an inferior one. Thus he is creatively active and, as circumstances demand, careful, so that even in a dangerous situation he does not make a mistake.   b ) 3. “All day long he is creatively active.” This is the way in which he carries out his undertakings.   c ) 3. “All day long he is creatively active.” He moves with the time.   d ) 9. The nine in the third place shows redoubled firmness and is moreover not in a central place. On the one hand, it is not yet in the heavens above; on the other hand, it is no longer in the field below. Therefore one must be creatively active and, as circumstances demand, careful. Then, despite the danger, no mistake is made.   On nine in the fourth place:   a ) 7. Nine in the fourth place means: “Wavering flight over the depths. No blame.” What does this signify?   The Master said: In ascent or descent there is no fixed rule, except that one must do nothing evil. In advance or retreat no sustained perseverance avails, except that one must not depart from one’s nature. The superior man fosters his character and labors at his task, in order to do everything at the right time. Therefore he makes no mistake.     b ) 4. “Wavering flight over the depths.” He tests his powers.   c ) 4. “Wavering flight over the depths.” Here the way of the Creative is about to transform itself.   d)  10. The nine in the fourth place is too rigid and not moderate. It is not yet in the heavens above, neither is it any longer in the field below nor in the middle regions of the human. Therefore it is said: “Wavering flight …” To waver means that one has freedom of choice, therefore one makes no mistake.   On nine in the fifth place:   a ) 8. Nine in the fifth place means: “Flying dragon in the heavens. It furthers one to see the great man.” What does this signify?   The Master said: Things that accord in tone vibrate together. Things that have affinity in their inmost nature seek one another. Water flows to what is wet, fire turns to what is dry. Clouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger. Thus the sage rises, and all creatures follow him with their eyes. What is born of heaven feels related to what is above. What is born of earth feels related to what is below. Each follows its kind.   b ) 5. “Flying dragon in the heavens.” This is the supreme way of ruling.   c ) 5. “Flying dragon in the heavens.” This is the place appropriate to heavenly character.   d ) 11. The great man accords in his character with heaven and earth; in his light, with the sun and moon; in his consistency, with the four seasons; in the good and evil fortune that he creates, with gods and spirits. When he acts in advance of heaven, heaven  does not contradict him. When he follows heaven, he adapts himself to the time of heaven. If heaven itself does not resist him, how much less do men, gods, and spirits!   On nine at the top:   a ) 9. Nine at the top means: “Arrogant dragon will have cause to repent.” What does this signify?   The Master said: He who is noble and has no corresponding position, he who stands high and has no following, he who has able people under him who do not have his support, that man will have cause for regret at every turn.   b ) 6. “Arrogant dragon will have cause to repent.” Everything that goes to extremes meets with misfortune.   c ) 6. “Arrogant dragon will have cause to repent.” In time he exhausts himself.   d ) 12. Arrogance means that one knows how to press forward but not how to draw back, that one knows existence but not annihilation, knows something about winning but nothing about losing.   It is only the holy man who understands how to press forward and how to draw back, who knows existence and annihilation as well, without losing his true nature. The holy man alone can do this.   On all the nines changing:   b ) 7. When THE CREATIVE, the great, undergoes change in all the nines, the world is set in order.   c ) 7. When THE CREATIVE, the great, undergoes change in all the nines, one perceives the law of heaven.     NOTE. The hexagram Ch’ien, THE CREATIVE, occupies a unique position, in that it is uniformly composed of firm lines all having a certain relation to one another. They form a sequence of stages, so that a genetic development in time can be observed. For this reason the judgments attached to the individual lines in this hexagram differ from those pertaining to any of the other hexagrams. In the case of THE CREATIVE, there can be no question of relationships of correspondence and holding together 8  between firm and yielding lines, such as determine the character of the other hexagrams; instead, the judgment takes into account solely the relation of the place to the nature of the line.   A characteristic difference between the upper and the lower trigram is to be noted. The lower pictures the development of the character of the creative power; the upper, the development of the external position. The first line and the fourth each mark a beginning. The first line, at the very bottom, still within the realm of earth (first and second places), is designated as hidden, latent. The fourth line, in the lowest place of the upper trigram, likewise indicates a beginning, that is, a changing of position. In themselves, the omens for this line are not favorable. Being firm in a yielding place, the line does not fit its place, and this might well imply a defect somewhere. But because the essence of the Creative is strength, it is explicitly emphasized that there is no mistake. The divergence between the character and the place of the line manifests itself instead in the potentiality of the decision, which is still in doubt.   The middle lines in the two trigrams, the second and the fifth, are extraordinarily favorable. The second line is central and as such is immediately to be conceived as correct. Since it is still in the lower trigram, it shows the inner nature of the great man, who is already becoming known (“in the field”) but does not yet hold an appropriate position. He must see the “great man” in the fifth place, with whom he is connected by kinship of character, and who, as ruler of the whole, can assign him the position suitable to him. These favorable omens hold in regard to the fifth line in a yet more marked degree. The second line shows the strong man in a weak, lowly  place; in the fifth line, however, character and position accord. It is a strong line in a strong place, in the sphere of heaven (fifth and sixth places); moreover, it is the ruler of the whole. Therefore it represents the great man whom it is worthwhile to see. Hence the two central lines carry no warning at all; they are altogether favorable.   It is different in the case of the two end lines, the third and the top line. Of the two, the third has the more favorable position. It is indeed too strong for the place of transition (strength of character intensified by strength of place), so that it would seem that mistakes are to be feared. However, since the whole hexagram deals with creative powers, excess of strength does no harm, for at the place of transition it can be applied to inner preparation for the new conditions. For the top line, however, matters are quite different. Here the end of the whole situation is reached. Although the place is weak, the line character is still strong. This divergence between what one wants to do and what one is able to do leads to remorse, since there is no possible way out."

    "name": "K’un / The Receptive",
    "judgment": "THE RECEPTIVE brings about sublime success,   Furthering through the perseverance of a mare.   If the superior man undertakes something and tries to lead,   He goes astray;   But if he follows, he finds guidance.   It is favorable to find friends in the west and south,   To forego friends in the east and north.   Quiet perseverance brings good fortune.   Commentary on the Decision   Perfect indeed is the sublimity of the Receptive. All beings owe their birth to it, because it receives the heavenly with devotion.   This is the explanation of the word “sublime” in the Judgment. The greatness of the Receptive is characterized as perfect. That which attains the ideal is perfect. This means that the Receptive is dependent on the Creative. While the Creative is the generating principle, to which all beings owe their beginning, because the soul comes from it, the Receptive is that which brings to birth, that which takes the seed of the heavenly into itself and gives to beings their bodily form.   The Receptive in its riches carries all things. Its nature is in harmony with the boundless. It  embraces everything in its breadth and illumines everything in its greatness. Through it, all individual beings attain success.   This is the explanation of the word “success” in the Judgment. Here also there is the contrasting complement to the Creative. While the Creative shields things—that is, covers them from above—the Receptive carries them, like a foundation that endures forever. Infinite accord with the Creative is its essence. This produces its success. The movement of the Creative is a direct forward movement, and its resting state is standstill; the movement of the Receptive is an opening out, and in its resting state it is closed. In the resting, closed state, it embraces all things as though in a vast womb. In the state of movement, of opening, it allows the divine light to enter, and by means of this light illuminates everything. This is the source of its success, which shows itself in the success of living beings. While the success of the Creative lies in the fact that individual beings receive their specific forms, the success of the Receptive causes them to thrive and unfold.   A mare belongs to the creatures of the earth; she roams the earth without bound. Yielding, devoted, furthering through perseverance: thus the superior man has a direction for his way of life.   While the Creative is symbolized by the dragon flying in the heavens, the Receptive is symbolized by the mare (combining strength and devotion) coursing over the earth. Being yielding and devoted must not exclude strength, for strength is necessary to the Receptive if it is to be the helper of the Creative. This strength is expressed in the words, “furthering through perseverance,” appearing in the commentary as the model for the way of life of the superior man. (The punctuation of the commentary deviates from that of the Judgment. Because of the rhyme, the commentary requires the literal translation, “Furthering through perseverance. Thus the superior man has somewhere to go.” In the Judgment, on the other hand, most interpreters make the last words a dependent clause  linked with what follows, and the sentence reads: “If the superior man undertakes something … he goes astray.” 1 )   Taking the lead brings confusion because one loses his way. Following with devotion—thus does one attain his permanent place.   In the west and south one finds friends, so that he proceeds with people of his own kind. In the east and north one must do without friends, so that he finally attains good fortune.   If the Receptive were to push ahead on its own initiative, it would deviate from its natural character and miss the way. By submitting to and following the Creative, it attains its appropriate permanent place.   The west and south, according to King Wên’s arrangement, are the region in which the feminine trigrams are placed. Here K’un is in the midst of the daughters. But the masculine trigrams (Ch’ien and the sons) are in the east and north, so that the Receptive in this region is alone. But the very fact that it is alone with the Creative is to its advantage. Thus the earth must be alone with heaven, the official must serve only the ruler, the wife must cleave only to the husband.   The good fortune of rest and perseverance depends on our being in accord with the boundless nature of the earth.   The earth is still. It does not act of itself but is constantly receptive to the influences of heaven. Thus its life becomes inexhaustible and eternal. Man likewise attains eternity if he does not strive vaingloriously to achieve everything of his own strength but quietly keeps himself receptive to the impulses flowing to him from the creative forces.",
    "image": "The earth’s condition is receptive devotion.   Thus the superior man who has breadth of character   Carries the outer world.   Heaven moves with power; therefore it is said of it that “it moves.” The earth completes within the form; hence, in reference to it, one says “condition.” Earth is doubled, indicating massiveness, which is necessary in order that it may dedicate itself without forfeiting its nature. Thus man too must possess inner strength, weight of character, and breadth of view, that he may endure the world without being swayed by it.",

Because the Receptive in its movements adapts itself to the Creative, these movements come to be exactly as they should be. Thus the earth brings forth all beings, each in its own kind, according to the will of the Creator. Square, firm, refers to unchangingness. Each kind of living being has a fixed law of existence, according to which it develops in a way that is unchanging. In this lies the greatness of the earth.   For this very reason the earth has no need of a purpose. Everything becomes spontaneously what it should rightly be, for in the law of heaven life has an inner light that it must involuntarily obey."

The six at the top tries to hold firm, although the situation of darkness is already at an end. At this moment the dark principle advances out of the realm of the morally indifferent and becomes positively evil. There ensues a battle with the light-giving primal power coming from without to oppose the darkness, in which both elements suffer harm.   When all the lines are sixes:     a ) Lasting perseverance furthers.   b ) “Lasting perseverance”: it ends in great things.     The sixes change into their opposites; they become light or great lines.     Commentary on the Words of the Text   In contrast to the considerable number of commentaries on THE CREATIVE comprised in the  Wên Yen , there is only one on THE RECEPTIVE.   On the Hexagram as a Whole   The Receptive is altogether yielding, yet firm in its movement. It is altogether still, yet in its nature square.   The mare is yielding, yet strong. So likewise is the Receptive, for only in this way can it be the peer of the Creative. It is altogether still within, because wholly dependent, yet it is bound immutably to definite laws in its manifestations—the bringing to birth of the different species. “Firm in movement” is the explanation of the text words “sublime success.” “Still, yet square” is the explanation of the text words “perseverance furthers.”   “If he follows, he finds guidance,” and thus obtains something enduring.   “It embraces everything,” and its power to transform is light-giving.   These sentences are amplifications of the Commentary on the Decision. The reference here is to the movement of the Receptive, which corresponds with the seasons of summer and autumn (south and west). At these times the Receptive is with “friends,” that is, obedient to the laws of heaven: it is giving life to all varieties of beings, each according to its kind—so sharing the eternity of heaven, embracing all things and bringing them to maturity, and thus in bright light showing its power to transform them.   The way of the Receptive—how devoted it is! It receives heaven into itself and acts in its own time.   These two activities correspond with winter and spring (north and east). The reference is to the solitary union with the Creative, the receiving of the seed, and its quiet ripening to birth.     The comments on THE RECEPTIVE are based on the character of the six in the second place, the ruler of the hexagram, just as the comments on THE CREATIVE are based on the nine in the fifth place in that hexagram.   On the Lines   On six at the beginning:   A house that heaps good upon good is sure to have an abundance of blessings. A house that heaps evil upon evil is sure to have an abundance of ills. Where a servant murders his master, where a son murders his father, the causes do not lie between the morning and evening of one day. It took a long time for things to go so far. It came about because things that should have been stopped were not stopped soon enough.   In the Book of Changes it is said: “When there is hoarfrost underfoot, solid ice is not far off.” This shows how far things go when they are allowed to run on.   According to Chu Hsi the last sentence should read: “This refers to the necessary vigilance,” i.e., the vigilance needed to stop in time those things which must naturally have evil consequences.   On six in the second place:   Straightness means righting things; squareness means fulfillment of duty. The superior man is serious, in order to make his inner life straight; he does his duty, in order to make his outer life square. Where seriousness and fulfillment of duty stand firm, character will not become one-sided.   “Straight, square, great. Without purpose, yet nothing remains unfurthered”: because one is never in doubt as to what one has to do.     The inner life becomes right through consistent seriousness; the outer life becomes correct (square) through fulfillment of duty. Duty has a shaping influence on outer life, yet it is by no means something external. Through seriousness and fulfillment of duty, character develops richly of itself; greatness comes unsought, of its own accord. Therefore in all matters the individual hits upon the right course instinctively and without reflection, because he is free of all those scruples and doubts which induce a timid vacillation and lame the power of decision.   On six in the third place:   The dark force possesses beauty but veils it. So must a man be when entering the service of a king. He must avoid laying claim to the completed work. This is the way of the earth, the way of the wife, the way of one who serves. It is the way of the earth to make no display of completed work but rather to bring everything to completion vicariously.   It is the duty of one who subordinates himself to conceal his own worth, without craving an independent position, and to let all the merits for the completed work go to the master for whom he is working.   On six in the fourth place:    When heaven and earth are creating in change and transformation, all plants and trees flourish; but when heaven and earth close, the able man withdraws into the dark.   In the Book of Changes it is said: “A tied-up sack. No blame, no praise.” This counsels caution.   The six in the fourth place is near the ruler but does not receive recognition from him. In such a case, the only right thing to do is to shut oneself off from the world. This is the resting state of the dark principle, the state in which it closes (cf. above).     On six in the fifth place:   The superior man is yellow and moderate; thus he makes his influence felt in the outer world through reason.   He seeks the right place for himself and dwells in the essential.   His beauty is within, but it gives freedom to his limbs and expresses itself in his works. This is the perfection of beauty.   Yellow is the color of the middle and of moderation. Inner moderation has an outer effect, because it imbues all forms of expression with reason. The right place sought by the superior man is found in the good form that makes him yield precedence to others and stay modestly in the background. Reserved grace, unseen yet present in all movements and deeds, is the perfection of beauty.   There is a characterizing difference in what is said about the lines of THE CREATIVE and THE RECEPTIVE. In the former the emphasis is always on the real, the unfailing, while in the latter the attributes stressed are seriousness, conscientiousness, and modesty. We are dealing with the same thing seen from two sides. Only truth leads to seriousness, and only seriousness makes truth possible.   On six at the top:   When the dark seeks to equal the light principle, there is certain to be a struggle. Lest one think that nothing of the light remains, the dragon is mentioned. But to make clear that there is no deviation from their kind, 5  blood is also mentioned. Black and yellow are heaven and earth in confusion. Heaven is black and earth yellow.   This explanation is somewhat obscurely expressed. The meaning is as follows: In the tenth month, the power of the dark  principle has completely triumphed; the last remaining light has been driven away. 6  The sun has reached its lowest position; the dark force rules unrestrained. But this is the very reason for the coming change to the opposite; the solstice takes place, and light struggles anew with darkness.   It is the same in all relationships. The dark principle cannot be the ruling one; it is in its proper place only when conditioned by the light principle, and submissive to it. If this is disregarded, and the dark principle tries to issue from its realm within and come forth upon the field of action without, the power of the light principle shows itself. The dragon, the symbol of the light-giving power, appears and drives the dark power back within its confines, as a sign that the light principle still exists. Blood is the symbol of the dark principle, just as breath is the symbol of the light principle. Since blood flows, the dark principle is injured. However, blood comes not only from the dark principle, for the light principle also suffers injury in this struggle; therefore the color is designated as black and yellow. Black, or rather dark blue, is the color of heaven, and yellow that of the earth. (It should be noted that the color symbolism here differs from that in the comments on the eight trigrams, where the Creative is said to be red and the Receptive black, i.e., dark.)   NOTE. Here, in contrast to the relationships in the hexagram of THE CREATIVE, the single lines do not have a developmental relation to one another, but stand side by side without interrelation. Each line represents a separate situation. This is in accord with the nature of the two hexagrams. THE CREATIVE represents time, producing sequence; THE RECEPTIVE represents space, which indicates juxtaposition.   With respect to the individual lines, the following is to be noted. The first and the top line, i.e., the two outside places, are unfavorable. The inner, not the outer place, is proper to the Receptive. The first line shows the dark principle taking the initiative (cf.  hexagram 44 , Kou, COMING TO MEET); this means danger. Therefore the dark principle is represented as something objective that must be opposed at the right time.     In the top place, the dark principle arrogates leadership to itself and enters into rivalry with the light principle. Here also it is represented objectively as the thing fought against (cf.  hexagram 43 , Kuai, BREAK-THROUGH); for these two situations are not in harmony with the nature of a superior man, and the Book of Changes is written only for superior men. Hence whatever is inferior is in every case something external or objective.   The middle lines of the primary trigrams, being central, are favorable. But in contrast to the situation in Ch’ien, the ruler here is in the second place instead of the fifth, for it is the nature of the Receptive to be below. Therefore we are here shown the way of the earth, of material, spatial nature, in which everything acts spontaneously. The fifth place shows modesty in human nature. The fact that garments are spoken of points rather to the image of a princess than to that of a prince (cf.  hexagram 54 , Kuei Mei, THE MARRYING MAIDEN, six in the fifth place).   The two transitional lines are neutral in meaning. The third has the possibility of entering the service of a king, for the weakness of its nature is compensated by the strength of its place. But while the third line of Ch’ien is self-contained, the third line of K’un is self-effacingly concerned only with serving others. The fourth line is too weak (a yielding line in a weak place), and moreover has no relationship with the fifth line. Hence withdrawal into itself is all that is left for it. The heightened passivity of this line corresponds with the heightened activity of the nine in the third place in Ch’ien, just as the third line in K’un corresponds in its undetermined possibilities with the nine in the fourth place of Ch’ien."

    "judgment": "Difficulty at the Beginning works supreme success,   Furthering through perseverance.   Nothing should be undertaken.   It furthers one to appoint helpers.   Commentary on the Decision   DIFFICULTY AT THE BEGINNING: the firm and the yielding unite for the first time, and the birth is difficult.   The lower primary trigram is Chên, the eldest son, who comes into being when the light power and the dark power first draw together. This indicates the first union. K’an, the upper primary trigram, means difficulty, danger. This indicates the difficulty of the birth.   Movement in the midst of danger brings great success and perseverance.   The lower trigram, Chên, is movement; the upper, K’an, is danger. Hence we have movement in the midst of danger. By movement one gets out of the danger. This explains the words of the text: “Supreme success, furthering through perseverance.”   The movement of thunder and rain fills the atmosphere. If chaos and darkness prevail while heaven is creating, it is fitting to appoint helpers, without being oneself thereby lulled to rest.   This too describes the filling up of the atmosphere with the difficulties that prevail up to the point when a thunderstorm  breaks. The final effect, however, is presaged in the fact that the two images are not instanced in the sequence [predicated by the structure of the hexagram] of K’an (clouds) above and Chên (thunder) below; instead, thunder is mentioned first and then the clouds, dissolved, are spoken of as rain.   Just as in a storm, thunder and darkening clouds precede release, so in the affairs of men a chaotic time precedes a period of order. At such a time a ruler entrusted with bringing order out of chaos needs efficient people. At first, however, the situation remains serious and difficult, and he must not try to rely wholly on others. This saying is suggested by the two rulers of the hexagram. The nine at the beginning indicates the efficient helper who should be appointed in such dangerous times; the nine in the fifth place means that there are still difficulties that preclude yielding to inaction. Because of the precarious conditions, the nine in the fifth place must still await the proper solution and may not yet rest.",

To overcome it, we must separate and combine, as happens when a thunderstorm breaks—first clouds above and thunder below, then thunder above and rain below.",

Commentary on the Decision   YOUTHFUL FOLLY shows danger at the foot of a mountain. Danger and standstill: this is folly.   The image of the hexagram, a mountain with a watery abyss in front of it, as well as the attributes of the two primary trigrams, indicating a danger before which one pauses, suggests the idea of folly.   “FOLLY has success.” One who succeeds hits upon the right time for his undertaking.     “It is not I who seek the young fool; the young fool seeks me.” The two positions correspond.   “At the first oracle I answer,” because the position is firm and central.   “If someone asks two or three times, it is importunity. If he importunes, I give no answer.” To importune is folly.   To strengthen what is right in a fool is a holy task.   The ruler of the hexagram is the strong second line. It is in the middle of the lower trigram, therefore in a central position. Since the line is strong and central, it meets with success by acting at the right time. It represents a sage in a lowly position, qualified to counsel wisely a youthful and inexperienced ruler. The youthful ruler is represented by the weak fifth line, which stands in the relationship of correspondence to the strong second line. The fifth line, which is weak in a superior place, and the second line, which is strong in an inferior place, together express the fact that the strong teacher does not seek out the young fool; rather, the latter approaches the teacher as one asking a favor. This is the correct relationship in education.   Because the second line is strong and central, it can answer the questions of the fifth, keeping within definite bounds of moderation. But if these bounds are overstepped with importunate questions, the teacher in turn becomes disagreeable toward the pupil by refusing to answer.   The saying in the text, “Perseverance furthers,” is amplified by the final comment, “To strengthen what is right in a fool is a holy task.”   In addition to the second line, the strong line at the top is also occupied with driving out youthful folly, while the remaining four lines represent youthful fools of various kinds.

A yielding line at the high point of danger, at the very top of the hexagram, is not really in its proper place (K’an connotes a pit). Although to all appearances a weak line in a weak place is where it should be, a certain impropriety arises from the fact that it stands at the top, while the line corresponding with it, the strong third line, is below. The arrival of three uninvited guests is suggested by this third line and the two lower ones of the trigram Ch’ien, which hold together with it. Since by virtue of their strong natures they are not jealous, everything  goes well, if the yin line follows its yielding nature and meets them deferentially.   NOTE. The situation revealed in WAITING is one in which a strong, firm nature is faced with danger. What is required of the individual here is restraint. He must await the proper time; he must be yielding and remain calm. If he does not weigh the time conditions sufficiently and presses forward, ruthless, angry, and restless, he will certainly meet defeat. The nine at the beginning is still far from danger; hence if one holds to lasting things, one can avoid mistakes. The nine in the second place is approaching closer to danger, but it too can ultimately attain good fortune by yielding and by keeping to the middle way. The nine in the third place is actually under threat of danger, therefore it is said; “Seriousness and caution prevent defeat.” The six in the fourth place has been overtaken by danger, but because it is yielding and peaceful, it gets out of the pit again. The six at the top is at the peak point of danger, but through deference it too finally attains good fortune. Thus during a time of waiting, self-control and deference are the means of avoiding harm.

Danger and strength produce conflict.   “The contender is sincere and is being obstructed.”   The firm comes and attains the middle.   “Going through to the end brings misfortune. A conflict must not be allowed to become permanent.”   “It furthers one to see the great man”: thus his central and correct position is honored.   “It does not further one to cross the great water,” for this would lead one into the abyss.   The name of the hexagram of CONFLICT is derived from the attributes of the two trigrams Ch’ien, strength, and K’an, danger. When strength is above and cunning below, conflict is sure to arise. Similarly, a person who is inwardly cunning and outwardly strong inclines to conflict with others.   The contender, the second line, is sincere and feels himself  obstructed. He is in the inner trigram, and therefore it is said, “He comes.” Because the line is strong and occupies the center, it suggests sincerity, for it makes the middle “sound.” It is obstructed because it is inclosed between the two yin lines. The great man is the central and correct line in the fifth place. The judge who must render the decision abides outside the dangerous situation. He can render a just decision only by remaining impartial. The abyss into which one would fall by crossing the great water is indicated by the trigram K’an, danger. Crossing of the great water is suggested by the fact that the nuclear trigram Sun, wood, is over the lower primary trigram K’an, water.

The reason is that on the one hand, when the hexagram is considered as a whole, the lower trigram as a unit is taken as joyous and obedient; on the other, however, in the judgment on the individual line, the latter is evaluated according to its unfavorable position, which bodes ill for it.

Success.”   In this way heaven and earth unite, and all beings come into union.   Upper and lower unite, and they are of one will.   The light principle is within, the shadowy without; strength is within and devotion without; the superior man is within, the inferior without.   The way of the superior man is waxing; the way of the inferior man is waning.   Taken as a whole and as one of the “calendar” hexagrams, this hexagram is interpreted with the idea that the strong lines entering from below are mounting, while the weak lines above are withdrawing from the hexagram. Therefore, “The small departs, the great approaches.”   The movement of the two trigrams toward each other gives rise to another interpretation. The lower, ascending trigram is Ch’ien, heaven. The upper, sinking trigram is K’un, the earth. Thus the two primary powers unite, and all things  enter upon union and development. This corresponds with the state of things at the beginning of the year.   In terms of the human world, with special reference to two lines—the six in the fifth place representing the prince, and the nine in the second place representing the officials—the result is unity between high and low, their wills being directed to a common goal. The positions of the two trigrams—within (below) and without (above)—lead to still another reflection. The yang power is within, the yin power without. This points to a difference in rank between the ruling yang power at the center and the dependent yin power at the periphery; this is further emphasized by the respective attributes of the trigrams, strength and devotion. These relative positions are likewise favorable for both elements.   In relation to the political field, another consideration arises from the difference in value between the superior persons symbolized by the light lines and the inferior persons symbolized by the dark lines. Good men are at the center of power and influence; inferior people are on the outside, subject to the influence of the good. This likewise works for the good of the whole.   The movement of the hexagram as a whole produces finally a victorious ascendancy of the principles of the good man and a withdrawal and defeat of the principles of inferior men.

Commentary on the Decision   MODESTY creates success, for it is the way of heaven to shed its influence downward and to create light and radiance. It is the way of the earth to be lowly and to go upward.   It is the way of heaven to make empty what is full and to give increase to what is modest. It is the way of the earth to change the full and to augment the modest. Spirits and gods bring harm to what is, full and prosper what is modest. It is the way of men to hate fullness and to love the modest.   Modesty that is honored spreads radiance. Modesty that is lowly cannot be ignored. This is the end attained by the superior man.   Here the structure of the hexagram is used to explain the saying that modesty creates success. The nine in the third place is the representative of the yang force, which has sunk down. It brings light and radiance, attributes of the trigram Kên, the mountain. The upper trigram K’un shows the earth as having moved upward (the nuclear trigram Chên has a rising movement). The law governing the abasing of the proud and the elevation of the modest is set forth in four ways: (1) in heaven: when the sun reaches the zenith, it begins to decline; when the moon is full, it wanes; when dark, it begins to wax; (2) on earth: high mountains become valleys, valleys become hills; water turns toward the heights and wears them down; water turns toward depth and fills it up (the lower  nuclear trigram is K’an, water); (3) in the effect of the forces of fate: powerful families draw down destruction upon themselves, modest ones become great; (4) among men: arrogance brings dislike in its train, modesty wins love.

Commentary on the Decision   “GRACE has success.” The yielding comes and gives form to the firm; therefore, “Success.” A detached firm line ascends and gives form to the yielding; therefore, “In small matters it is favorable to undertake something.” This is the form of heaven. Having form, clear and still: this is the form of men. If the form of heaven is contemplated, the changes of time can be discovered. If the forms of men are contemplated, one can shape the world.   The text of the commentary does not appear to be intact. There seems to be a sentence missing before, “This is the form of heaven.” Wang Pi 1  says: “The firm and the yielding unite alternately and construct forms: this is the form of heaven.” This was taken as the original text, now missing, but Mao Ch’i Ling 2  takes another view and sees in it only an explanation of the foregoing sentence. But something of the sort must in fact be presupposed.     The yielding element that comes is the six in the second place. It places itself between the two firm lines and gives them success, gives them form. The strong element that detaches itself is the nine at the top. It places itself at the head of the two upper yielding lines and gives them the possibility of attaining form. In each case, the yang principle is the content, the yin principle the form. In the first case it is the yin line that bestows form directly and therefore brings about success, whereas the ascending yang line, by lending content, only indirectly provides the material on which the otherwise empty form of the yin lines can work itself out. Hence the effect is that it is favorable for “the small” to undertake something.   The form of heaven is symbolized by the four trigrams constituting the hexagram. The lower primary trigram Li is the sun, the lower nuclear trigram K’an is the moon; the upper nuclear trigram Chên by its movement represents the Great Bear, and the upper primary trigram Kên by its stillness represents the constellations. If one observes the rotation of the Great Bear, one knows the course of the year; through contemplation of the course of the sun and the phases of the moon, one recognizes the time of day and the periods of the month.   The form of human life results from the clearly defined (Li) and firmly established (Kên) rules of conduct, within which love (light principle) and justice (dark principle) build up the combinations of content and form. Here too love is the content and justice the form.",

Moistness is the height of grace, and the line moreover stands at the highest point of the trigram Li, clarity. But since it also stands in the middle of the nuclear trigram K’an, the abyss, there is a danger that it may be submerged. Hence the praise of constant perseverance as a protection against this danger."

It is an eternal cyclic movement, from which life comes forth again just at the  moment when it appears to have been completely vanquished. Through the re-entrance of the yang line into the hexagram below, movement develops (Chên, the lower trigram), and this movement acts through devotion (K’un, the upper trigram). Going out and coming in are without error. The yang force has indeed gone (cf. the foregoing hexagram, Po), but like a fruit falling to earth, it has not disappeared without a trace; it has left an effect behind. This effect shows itself in the re-entrance of the yang line. The friends who come are either the other yang lines about to enter the hexagram after this first line (according to Ch’êng Tz u), or the five yin lines, which meet the yang line cordially.

The firm is in the middle and finds correspondence.   “Great success through correctness”: this is the will of heaven.   “If someone is not as he should be, he has misfortune, and it does not further him to undertake anything.” When innocence is gone, where can one go? When the will of heaven does not protect one, can one do anything?   The firm element coming from without is the lowest line, a yang line. It comes from heaven (Ch’ien). The Receptive, in  approaching the Creative for the first time, receives the first line of Ch’ien and gives birth to Chên, the eldest son. Applied to man, this means that he receives the primal divine spirit as his guide and master. The attribute of the lower trigram, Chên, is movement, that of the upper, Ch’ien, is strength. The firm line in a central position that finds correspondence is the upper ruler of the hexagram, the nine in the fifth place, and the six in the second place corresponds with it. This all leads to success, because it shows man in the proper relationship to the divine, without ulterior designs and in primal innocence. Thus man is in harmony with heavenly fate, the will of heaven, just as the lower trigram harmonizes in movement with the upper.

Gentle and joyous in action: then it furthers one to have somewhere to go, then one has success.   Great indeed is the time of PREPONDERANCE OF THE GREAT.   The name is explained on the basis of the structure. The great, that is, the yang element, outnumbers with its four lines the two lines of the yin element. This by itself would not mean preponderance, but the great is within, although it belongs without. Similarly, the small preponderates (cf.  hexagram 62 ) when weak lines are in the majority and without, for by their nature they belong within. As representing preponderance of the great, the hexagram suggests the image of a ridgepole, the top beam of a house, on which the whole roof rests. Since beginning and end are weak, there arises the danger of a too great inner weight and of consequent sagging to the breaking point.   Despite this extraordinary situation, action is important. If the weight were to remain where it is, misfortune would arise.

The danger of heaven lies in the fact that one cannot climb it. The dangers of earth are the  mountains and rivers, hills and heights. The kings and princes make use of danger to protect their realms.   The effects of the time of danger are truly great.   This hexagram is explained in two ways. First, man finds himself in danger, like water in the depths of an abyss. The water shows him how to behave: it flows on without piling up anywhere, and even in dangerous places it does not lose its dependable character. In this way the danger is overcome. The trigram K’an further means the heart. In the heart the divine nature is locked within the natural inclinations and tendencies) and is thus in danger of being engulfed by desires and passions. Here likewise the way to overcome danger is to hold firmly to one’s innate disposition to good. This is indicated by the fact that the firm lines form each the middle in one of the trigrams.

Keeping Still and joyousness. 1  The masculine subordinates itself to the feminine. Hence it is said:   “Success. Perseverance furthers. To take a maiden to wife brings good fortune.”   Heaven and earth stimulate each other, and all things take shape and come into being. The holy man stimulates the hearts of men, and the world attains peace and rest. If we contemplate the outgoing stimulating influences, we can know the nature of heaven and earth and all beings.   Hsien differs from the character  kan , “to stimulate,” in that the heart is not a constituent part of it, as it is of the latter. Hence it represents an influence that is unconscious and involuntary, not one that is conscious and willed. It is a matter of objective relationships of a general kind, not those of a subjective, individual character.   The “weak above” is the trigram Tui, the youngest daughter; its attribute is joyousness, its image is the lake. The “strong below” is Kên, the youngest son; its attribute is keeping still, its image is the mountain.

The relation of the two images shows how this influence comes about: it is only when a mountain is empty at its summit, that is, deepened into a hollow, that a lake can form. Thus the superior man receives people by virtue of emptiness. The superior man is compared to the mountain, the people to the lake.

Or it can instead yield to the influence of the six at the beginning, to which it is related. Thereby it limits its influence; everything is shifted to the conscious plane, and the inner light darkens. This possibility is suggested by the fact that the line is the lowest in the trigram Tui, hence deepest within the realm of the shadowy (Tui is a yin trigram, therefore dark). Confucius says of this line:   What need has nature of thought and care? In nature all things return to their common source and are distributed along different paths; through one action, the fruits of a hundred thoughts are realized. What need has nature of thought, of care?"

The strong is above, the weak below; thunder and wind work together.   Gentle and in motion. The strong and the weak all correspond: this signifies duration.   “Success. No blame. Perseverance furthers”: this means lasting perseverance in one’s course. The course of heaven and earth is enduring and long and never ends.   “It furthers one to have somewhere to go.” This means that an end is always followed by a new beginning.   Sun and moon have heaven and can therefore shine forever. The four seasons change and transform, and thus can forever bring to completion. The holy man remains forever in his course, and the world reshapes itself to completion. If we meditate on what gives duration to a thing, we can understand the nature of heaven and earth and of all beings.     The organization of the hexagram shows the strong Chên above and the weak Sun below; this is the enduring condition in the world. Here the eldest son and the eldest daughter are united in marriage, in contrast to the situation in the preceding hexagram, which represents entering into marriage.   The images show thunder, which is carried still farther by the power of wind, and wind, which is strengthened by the power of thunder. Their combined action imparts duration to both. The attribute of the trigram Sun is gentleness, that of Chên is movement. The outer movement, supported within by devotion, is likewise such that it is capable of duration.   Finally, the hexagram is given inner firmness by the correspondence between the individual lines. The six in the first place corresponds with the nine in the fourth; the nine in the second place with the six in the fifth; the nine in the third place with the six at the top.   All this serves to explain the name of the hexagram.   On the basis of the Judgment, the conditions necessary for duration are then set forth. They consist in perseverance in the right course, that is to say, continuity in change. This is the secret of the eternity of the universe.   Perseverance in a course leads to the goal, the end. However, since the course is cyclic, a new beginning is joined with every end. Movement and rest beget each other. This is the rhythm of all happening. The operation of this principle in specific instances, in relation to the macrocosm and the microcosm, is then pointed out.",

Heaven has a strong upward movement and therefore automatically retreats from the mountain, whose character is immobility. An even greater divergence occurs in the hexagram P’i, STANDSTILL ( 12 ), in which the movements are directly opposed.   What the situation in the present hexagram teaches is, as in the case of P’i, deduced from the attributes of the trigrams taken separately.

Two daughters live together, but their minds are not directed to common concerns.   Joyousness and dependence upon clarity: the yielding progresses and goes upward, attains the middle,  and finds correspondence in the firm. This is why there is good fortune in small matters.   Heaven and earth are opposites, but their action is concerted. Man and woman are opposites, but they strive for union. All beings stand in opposition to one another: what they do takes on order thereby. Great indeed is the effect of the time of OPPOSITION.   The name of the hexagram is derived from the relationships developing out of the movement of the two trigrams. Fire flames upward, water seeps downward: when they are quiescent, their movements can unite; when they are in motion, they draw farther and farther apart. The two daughters are originally together in the parental house. Their ways part as they grow up and marry into different families. Thus the movement leads more and more to opposition. However, since this movement is a natural one, it comes of itself to a turning when it has reached an extreme.   The trigram Tui has joyousness as an attribute; the trigram Li, dependence upon clarity. Joyousness unites, clarity finds the right way for this. Furthermore, the relations of the two rulers of the hexagram are favorable, so that there is a possibility of success at least in small matters.   However, Confucius goes still further. He shows that opposition is actually the natural prerequisite for union. As a result of opposition, a need to bridge it arises; this is true as regards heaven and earth, man and woman. Similarly, it is the individual differences between things that enable us to differentiate them clearly and hence to classify them. This is the effect of the phase of opposition—a phase that must be transcended.",

Commentary on the Decision   OBSTRUCTION means difficulty. The danger is ahead. To see the danger and to know how to stand still, that is wisdom.   In OBSTRUCTION “the southwest furthers,” because he goes and attains the middle.   “The northeast does not further,” because there the way comes to an end.   “It furthers one to see the great man,” because he goes and wins merits.   In the right place, “perseverance brings good fortune,” because through it the country comes into order.   The effect of a time of OBSTRUCTION is great indeed.   Danger, the trigram K’an, is in front. To see the danger (upper nuclear trigram Li, light, eye) and to stop short in time (inner trigram Kên, Keeping Still) is true wisdom, in contrast to the situation in YOUTHFUL FOLLY, where the positions of danger and standstill are reversed. In order to overcome the danger it is important to take the safe-road, the road toward the southwest, where one attains the middle, that is, sees oneself surrounded by helpers. The nine in the fifth place does  this. When the ruler of the hexagram is in the outer trigram it is said, “He goes,” and when it is in the inner trigram, “He comes.” In the northeast (north means danger, northeast means mountain) one comes to an impassable road, leading no farther. It is favorable to see the great man—the nine in the fifth place, standing at the top of the nuclear trigram Li. Through going something is achieved: in that the ruler of the hexagram “goes,” he takes part in the downward movement of the trigram K’an, water, which flows toward the earth and thus accomplishes something. Abiding in the right place brings good fortune, because one’s activity is directed not outward but inward, to one’s own country. Turning inward is achieved through obstructions, and the improvement brought about by this turning inward (“conversion”) is the great value inhering in the effect of a time of obstruction.",

Through movement one escapes danger: this is deliverance.   During deliverance “the southwest furthers”: by going he wins the multitude.   “His return brings good fortune,” because he wins the central position.   “If there is still something where one has to go, hastening brings good fortune.” Then going is meritorious.   When heaven and earth deliver themselves, thunder and rain set in. When thunder and rain set in, the seed pods of all fruits, plants, and trees break open.   The time of DELIVERANCE is great indeed.   Danger incites to movement, and this movement leads out of the danger; this explanation of the name of the hexagram is derived from the attributes of the two primary trigrams. The southwest is the place of the trigram K’un, the Receptive. Its opposite, the northeast, is no longer mentioned, because here the difficulties have already been overcome. K’un also means the multitude. This refers to the six in the fifth place. When  deliverance has only just come, a certain protection is needed, a quiet nurturing under the maternal care of the Receptive. By returning when there is nothing more to be attended to, the nine in the second place attains the center of the lower trigram. If there is still something to be done, it brings good fortune to do it as quickly and carefully as possible, because the movement is then crowned with success; it is not a purposeless, futile effort.

At the outset it consisted of the three strong lines of the trigram Ch’ien, the Creative. They have been journeying together. Then one leaves them and goes up to the top of the upper trigram. The weak line entering the third place in its stead is lonely in the company of the two other lines of the lower trigram.

The fourth line, in descending from the upper trigram to the lowest place in the lower trigram, shows a self-abnegation that gives proof of great clarity.

The attributes of the trigrams Chên, movement, and Sun, gentleness, guarantee lasting progress.   The idea of increase in the cosmic sphere is expressed through the fact that the first line of heaven (Ch’ien) places itself below the earth (K’un), this gives rise to the trigram Chên, in which all beings come into existence.

The weak advances to meet the firm.   “One should not marry such a maiden.” This means that one cannot live with her permanently.   When heaven and earth meet, all creatures settle into firm lines.   When the firm finds the middle and the right, everything under heaven prospers splendidly.   Great indeed is the meaning of the time of COMING TO MEET.   Sun is the eldest daughter. A yin line develops within and rules the hexagram, while the yang lines stand aside as guests. In this way the yin element becomes increasingly powerful. This is the line of the trigram K’un of which it is said: “When there is hoarfrost underfoot, solid ice is not far off.” Hence the gradual expansion must be checked in time, for the way of inferior people increases only because superior men entrust them with power. If this is avoided when the inferior element first appears, the danger can be averted.   When the strong element appears for the first time in the midst of yin lines, the hexagram is called RETURN. The superior man always stays where he belongs. He comes only into his own domain. When the weak element first appears in the midst of yang lines, the hexagram is called COMING TO MEET (or ENCOUNTERING). The inferior man always has to depend on a lucky chance.   Marriage is an institution that is meant to endure. But if a girl associates with five men, her nature is not pure and one cannot live with her permanently. Therefore one should not marry her.     However, things that must be avoided in human society have meaning in the processes of nature. Here the meeting of earthly and heavenly forces is of great significance, because at the moment when the earthly force enters and the heavenly force is at its height—in the fifth month—all things unfold to the high point of their material manifestation, and the dark force cannot injure the light force. The two rulers of the hexagram, the nine in the fifth place and the nine in the second, likewise symbolize such a fortunate meeting. Here a strong and central assistant meets a strong, central, and correct ruler. A great flowering results, and the inferior element below can do no harm.

Mountain and temple are both places where great offerings are brought. Wind, the upper nuclear trigram Sun, means the influence of what is above, as a result of which works begun will meet with success.   The name of the hexagram is explained in the Commentary on the Decision in a number of ways: (1) the attributes of the two trigrams are devotion and joyousness, on the basis of which gathering together takes place; (2) a gathering needs a head, a center of crystallization, and this is provided in the nine in the fifth place, around which the other lines gather. In order to gather the people together, the ruler above needs  joyousness (Tui); the people below show themselves devoted (K’un).

Commentary on the Decision   Penetrating under water and bringing up the water: this is THE WELL.   The well nourishes and is not exhausted.   “The town may be changed, but the well cannot be changed,” because central position is combined with firmness.   “If one gets down almost to the water and the rope does not go all the way,” one has not yet achieved anything.   “If the jug breaks”: this brings misfortune.   It seems as though the text at the beginning of the commentary were somewhat incomplete. Yet nothing of the essential meaning has been lost. The first half of the Judgment refers to the nature of the well. It is the unchangeable within change. The upper trigram K’an indicates a well, and the lower trigram Sun symbolizes a town. The ruler of the hexagram is in the  upper trigram, hence the idea of no change. The second half of the text refers to the dangers connected with using the well. The trigram Sun means a rope, the nuclear trigram Li a hollow vessel, the nuclear trigram Tui means to break in pieces. In this way the danger of breaking the jug is indicated.   The hexagram also contains a symbolic meaning. Just as water in its inexhaustibility is the basic requisite of life, so the “way of kings”—good government—is the indispensable foundation of the life of the state. Place and time may change, but the methods for regulating the collective life of the people remain forever the same. Evil conditions arise only when the right people are not at hand to execute the plan. This is symbolized by the shattering of the jug before it has reached the water.",

The well symbolism in the Image is again applied to government, the well itself being regarded as the center of the social structure. There is likewise an allusion to the agrarian system ascribed to remotest antiquity. In this system the fields were so divided that eight families with their fief lands were grouped around a center that held the well and the settlement, and that had to be cultivated in common for the benefit of the central government. The form of the settlement was suggested in the ideogram for  ching ,  . The fields were divided as follows:     Fields 1 to 8 were used by the individual families; field 9 contained the well, together with the settlement and the lord’s fields. Under this arrangement, the members of the settlement naturally had to rely on co-operative work.   The influence of the government on the people is suggested by the two trigrams. Encouragement of the people at their  work corresponds with the trigram K’an, which symbolizes work or drudgery ( lao ).

Water and fire subdue each other. Two daughters dwell together, but their views bar mutual understanding. This means revolution.   “On your own day you are believed”: one brings about a revolution and in doing so is trusted.   Enlightenment, and thereby joyousness: you create great success through justice.   If in a revolution one hits upon the right thing, “remorse disappears.”   Heaven and earth bring about revolution, and the four seasons complete themselves thereby.   T’ang and Wu 1  brought about political revolutions because they were submissive toward heaven and in accord with men.   The time of REVOLUTION is truly great.   Molting depends on fixed laws; it is prepared in advance. The same is true of political revolutions. The expression “on your own day” points—as in the case of the hexagram Ku, WORK ON WHAT HAS BEEN SPOILED ( 18 )—to one of the ten cyclic signs. These ten cyclic signs are: (1) Chia, (2) I, (3) Ping, (4) Ting, (5) Wu, 2  (6) Chi, (7) Kêng, (8) Hsin, (9) Jên, (10) Kuei. As noted earlier in connection with  hexagram 18 , the eighth of these signs, Hsin [metal, autumn], has also the secondary meaning of renewal, and the seventh, Kêng, means change. Now the sign before Kêng is Chi, hence it is on the day before  the change takes place that one is believed (therefore the rendering “your own day”;  chi  also means “own”). If the cyclic signs are combined with the eight trigrams as correlated with the cardinal points in the Sequence of Later Heaven [Inner-World Arrangement], it will be found that K’un stands for Chi—which means earth—in the southwest, 3  midway between Tui in the west and Li in the south, that is, between the two trigrams that combat and subdue each other. The earth in the middle balances their influences, so that the clarity of fire (Li) and the joyousness of water (Tui) can manifest themselves separately. Hence the need of enlightenment and joyousness in gaining the popular confidence necessary for a revolution.   As revolutions in nature take place according to fixed laws and thus give rise to the cycle of the year, so political revolutions—these can become necessary at times for doing away with a state of decay—must follow definite laws. First, one must be able to await the right moment. Second, one must proceed in the right way, so that one will have the sympathy of the people and so that excesses will be avoided. Third, one must be correct and entirely free of all selfish motives. Fourth, the change must answer a real need. This was the character of the great revolutions brought about in the past by the rulers T’ang and Wu.",

The yielding advances and goes upward. It attains the middle and finds correspondence in the firm; hence there is supreme success.   The whole hexagram, with its sequence of divided and undivided lines, is the image of a  ting , from the legs below to the handle rings at the top. The trigram Sun below means wood and penetration; Li above means fire. Thus wood is put into fire, and the fire is kept up for the preparation of the meal.

The fear thus aroused makes one cautious, and caution brings good fortune. “Laughing words—ha, ha”: the words are suggested by the sound of thunder, which sounds like “ha, ha.” They are a symbol of inner calm in the midst of the storm of outer movement.   “The shock terrifies for a hundred miles”: this is the sound of thunder, which is at the same time the symbol of a mighty ruler (suggested by the idea of the eldest son) who knows how to make himself respected by all those about him, yet is careful and exact in the smallest detail. The concluding sentence also refers to this. The lord of the sacrifices is at the same time the lord of the house or of the realm. In this regard also the eldest son had his special task. The trigram Chên means the coming forth of God in the spring and also the reawakening of the life force, which stirs again from below.",

Commentary on the Decision   KEEPING STILL means stopping.   When it is time to stop, then stop.   When it is time to advance, then advance.   Thus movement and rest do not miss the right time,   And their course becomes bright and clear.   Keeping his stopping still 1  means stopping in his place. Those above and those below are in opposition and have nothing in common. Therefore it is said: “He does not feel his body. He goes into his courtyard and does not see his people. No blame.”   The nature of the hexagram predicates a separation of the upper and the lower trigram. This is indicated also by the divergent movements of the nuclear trigrams, the upper going upward and the lower downward. Keeping still is the meaning of the hexagram itself, movement is the meaning of the nuclear trigrams. Therefore it is explained that movement and stopping, each at the right time, are both features of rest: the one is continuance in a state of movement, the other continuance in a state of rest. The hexagram Kên has an inner brilliance, because the light line at the top is above the two dark ones and so is not darkened; hence the saying: “Their course becomes bright and clear.”   The back is that part of the body which is invisible to oneself; keeping the back still symbolizes making the self still. The lower primary trigram indicates this keeping still of the back, so that one is no longer aware of one’s body, that is, of one’s personality. The upper primary trigram means courtyard. The  individual lines of the upper trigram have no relation to the corresponding lines of the lower trigram, hence the upper and the lower trigram turn their backs on each other, as it were.

Commentary on the Decision   THE MARRYING MAIDEN describes the great meaning of heaven and earth. If heaven and earth do not unite, all creatures fail to prosper.   THE MARRYING MAIDEN means the end and beginning of humanity.   Joyousness in movement: she who marries is the young girl.   “Undertakings bring misfortune.” The places are not the appropriate ones.   “Nothing that would further.” The yielding rests upon the hard.   In the sequence of the trigrams in the Primal Arrangement, 3  which corresponds with the world of the idea, Ch’ien is in the south and K’un in the north; Li is in the east as the sun and K’an in the west as the moon. In the Inner-World Arrangement, which corresponds with the phenomenal world, the action is transferred to the four trigrams Chên (east), Li (south),  Tui (west), and K’an (north). Sun and moon here take the place of heaven and earth as active forces. Heaven, Ch’ien, has withdrawn to the northwest, and the eldest son, Chên, in the east, is the originator of life. The earth, K’un, has withdrawn to the southwest, and the youngest daughter, Tui, in the west, presides over harvest and birth. Thus the present hexagram indicates the cosmic order of the relations of the sexes and the cycle of life.   The interpretation given by Liu Yüan 4  in the  Chou I Hêng Chieh  is significant. He sees in the hexagram not the maiden (Tui) following an older man (Chên), but the elder brother (Chên) leading his younger sister to her husband. A certain basis for this view is afforded by the words accompanying the fifth line. We are dealing here with reminiscences of matriarchal times disseminated in popular romance by the story of how Chung K’uei gave his sister in marriage.   THE MARRYING MAIDEN means the beginning and end of humanity, as Chên in the east means spring, ascent, and Tui in the west means autumn, decline. The commentary then explains the name of the hexagram by citing the attributes of the two trigrams—Tui, joyousness, and Chên, movement. The judgment on the hexagram, “Undertakings bring misfortune,” is derived from the position of the four middle lines, none of which is in its proper place. “Nothing that would further” results from the position of the six in the third place (one of the rulers of the hexagram), which is over the hard nine in the second place, and from the positions of the other two rulers, the six in the fifth place and the six at the top, both over the hard nine in the fourth place.",

At that moment the death-dealing power of autumn, which destroys all transient beings, becomes active.

How much truer is this of men, or of spirits and gods!   Fêng represents a time when clarity and progress bring about greatness and prosperity in public life. To achieve these, there is needed a strong and leading personality, drawing to itself others of like nature. Therefore it is not the relation of correspondence but that of congruity between the lines which must be taken into account (cf. the nine at the beginning and the nine in the fourth place, as well as the six in the second place and the six in the fifth place). But such a time of very great culture also carries hidden dangers. For according to the universal law of events, every increase is followed by decrease, and all fullness is followed by emptiness. There is only one means of making foundations firm in times of greatness, namely, spiritual expansion. Every sort of limitation brings a bitter retribution in its train.

Both of the yielding lines submit to the strong; therefore it is said: “Success through what is small. It furthers one to have somewhere to go.

In the issuing of commands, it is all-important that they really penetrate the consciousness of the subordinates. This is effected by adaptation of the commands to their understanding. A twofold penetration is required: first penetration of a command to the feeling of the vassals, scattering the evil hidden in secret recesses, as the wind scatters clouds; second, a still deeper penetration, to the depths of consciousness, where the hidden good must be awakened. To obtain this effect, commands must be given repetitively. 1   The text is further explained in the light of the structure of the hexagram. The strong line that has penetrated to the center—the correct place for it—is the nine in the fifth place; therefore its will is done, and it is favorable to undertake something.

In contrast to the situation in Ku, WORK ON WHAT HAS BEEN SPOILED ( 18 ), where it is question of compensating for what the father and mother have spoiled, it is work on public matters that is described here. Such work is characterized not so much by love that covers up defects as by impartial justice, as symbolized by the west (metal, autumn), with which the eighth cyclic sign, Kêng 2  (rendered as “change”), is associated.     In order to enforce commands, it is necessary first to abandon a wrong beginning, then to attain the good end; hence the saying: “No beginning, but an end.” This saying is elaborated in the words: “Before the sign Kêng, three days. After the sign Kêng, three days.” The problem turns therefore on a decisive elimination of something that has developed as a wrong beginning. Three “days” before Kêng the summer draws to a close; then comes its end. Three “days” after Kêng comes winter, the end of the year. Therefore, although one has not achieved a beginning, at least the end is attainable. (This situation differs from that in  hexagram 18 , Ku, which lies in the middle between end and beginning.)"

The action connoted by the hexagram is based upon the reciprocal relationships between the three lines in the fifth, the fourth, and the second place.   The king in the middle is the nine in the fifth place. His central position denotes the inner concentration that enables him to hold together the elements striving to break asunder.

Joyous in passing through danger; in the appropriate place, in order to limit; central and correct, in order to unite.   Heaven and earth have their limitations, and the four seasons of the year arise.   Where limitation is applied in the creation of institutions, property is not encroached upon, and people are not harmed.   There are three yang lines and three yin lines symmetrically distributed—first two yang lines, then two yin lines, then one of each. Hence there are strong lines in the two central places, the second and the fifth.   To persist in galling limitation would lead to failure. But owing to the central and moderate behavior of the ruler of the” hexagram, the nine in the fifth place, this danger is overcome. Joyousness is the attribute of the lower trigram Tui, and danger that of the upper trigram K’an. The limitation of the ruler of the hexagram is brought about by the two yin lines between which it stands. But owing to its central and correct position, it attains an all-pervading influence.

The point here is that the time demands a restraint that would appear to be excessive. It is a time like that of King Wên and the tyrant Chou Hsin, and this restraint, which might appear exaggerated, is exactly what the time calls for.

THE YARROW-STALK ORACLE   The oracle is consulted with the help of yarrow stalks. Fifty stalks are used for this purpose. One is put aside and plays no further part. The remaining 49 stalks are first divided into two heaps [at random]. Thereupon one stalk is taken from the right-hand heap and put between the ring finger and the little finger of the left hand. Then the left-hand heap is placed in the left hand, and the right hand takes from it bundles of 4, until there are 4 or fewer stalks remaining. This remainder is placed between the ring finger and the middle finger of the left hand. Next the right-hand heap is counted off by fours, and the remainder is placed between the middle finger and the forefinger of the left hand. The sum of the stalks now between the fingers of the left hand is either 9 or 5. (The various possibilities are 1 + 4 + 4, or 1 + 3 + 1, or 1 + 2 + 2, or 1 + 1 + 3; it follows that the number 5 is easier to obtain than the number 9.) At this first counting off of the stalks, the first stalk—held between the little finger and the ring finger—is disregarded as supernumerary, hence one reckons as follows: 9 = 8, or 5 = 4. The number 4 is regarded as a complete unit, to which the numerical value 3 is assigned. The number 8, on the other hand, is regarded as a double unit and is reckoned as having only the numerical value 2., Therefore, if at the first count 9 stalks are left over, they count as 2; if 5 are left, they count as 3. These stalks are now laid aside for the time being.   Then the remaining stalks are gathered together again and divided anew. Once more one takes a stalk from the pile on the right and places it between the ring finger and the little finger of the left hand; then one counts off the stalks as before. This time the sum of the remainders is either 8 or 4, the possible combinations being 1 + 4 + 3, or 1 + 3 + 4, or 1 + 1 + 2, or 1 + 2 + 1,  so that this time the chances of obtaining 8 or 4 are equal. The 8 counts as 2, the 4 counts as 3.   The procedure is carried out a third time with the remaining stalks, and again the sum of the remainders is 8 or 4.   Now, from the numerical values assigned to each of the three composite remainders, a line is formed.   If the sum is 5 (= 4, value 3) + 4 (value 3) + 4 (value 3), the resulting numerical value is 9, the so-called old yang. This becomes a positive line that moves and must therefore be taken into account in the interpretation of the individual lines. It is designated by the symbol   or o.   If the sum of the composite remainders is 9 (= 8, value 2) + 8 (value 2) + 8 (value 2), the final value is 6, the so-called old yin. This becomes a negative line that moves and is therefore to be taken into account in the interpretation of the individual lines. It is designated by the symbol — X — or X.   If the sum is   9 (2) + 8 (2) + 4 (3)   or 5 (3) + 8 (2) + 8 (2) = 7   or 9 (2) + 4 (3) + 8 (2)   the value 7 results, the so-called young yang. This becomes a positive line that is at rest and therefore not taken into account in the interpretation of the individual lines. It is designated by the symbol —.   If the sum is   9 (2) + 4 (3) + 4 (3)   or 5 (3) + 4 (3) + 8 (2) = 8   or 5 (3) + 8 (2) + 4 (3)   the value 8 results, the so-called young yin. This becomes a negative line that is at rest and therefore not taken into account in the interpretation of the individual lines. It is designated by the symbol — —.   This procedure is repeated six times, and thus a hexagram of six stages is built up. When a hexagram consists entirely of nonmoving lines, the oracle takes into account only the idea represented by the hexagram as a whole, as set down in the Judgment by King Wên and in the Commentary on the Decision by Confucius, together with the Image.     If there are one or more moving lines in the hexagram thus obtained, the words appended by the Duke of Chou to the given line or lines are also to be considered. His words therefore carry the superscription, “Nine in the  x th place,” or “Six in the  x th place.”   Furthermore, the movement, i.e., change 1  in the lines, gives rise to a new hexagram, the meaning of which must also be taken into account. For instance, when we get  hexagram 56     showing a moving line in the fourth place     we must take into account not only the text 2  and the Image belonging to this hexagram as a whole, but also the text that goes with the fourth line, and in addition both the text and the Image belonging to  hexagram 52 :     Thus  hexagram 56  would be the starting point of a development leading, by reason of the situation of the nine in the fourth place and the appended counsel, to the final situation, i.e.,  hexagram 52 .   In the second hexagram the text belonging to the moving line is disregarded.   2. THE COIN ORACLE   In addition to the method of the yarrow-stalk oracle, there is in use a shorter method employing coins: for this as a rule old Chinese bronze coins, with a hole in the middle and an  inscription on one side, are used. Three coins are taken up and thrown down together, and each throw gives a line. The inscribed side counts as yin, with the value 2, and the reverse side counts as yang, with the value 3. From this the character of the line is derived. If all three coins are yang, the line is a 9; if all three are yin, it is a 6.   Two yin and one yang yield a 7, and two yang and one yin yield an 8. In looking up the hexagrams in the Book of Changes, one proceeds as with the yarrow-stalk oracle.   There is yet another kind of coin oracle, employing, besides the hexagrams of the  I Ching , the “five stages of change,” the cyclic signs, etc. This oracle is used by Chinese soothsayers, but without the text of the hexagrams of the  I Ching . It is said to be a perpetuation of the ancient tortoise oracle, which was consulted in antiquity in addition to the yarrow-stalk oracle. In the course of time it was gradually supplanted by the  I Ching , in the more rational form imparted to it by Confucius.  II.

I cannot make myself take seriously the claim that Confucius did not know the Book of Changes.   1 . Legge makes the following comment on the explanatory text for the individual lines: “According to our notions, a framer of emblems should be a good deal of a poet, but those of the Yi only make us think of a dryasdust. Out of more than three hundred and fifty, the greater number are only grotesque” ( The Sacred Books of the East , XVI:  The Yi King ,.2nd edn., Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1899, p. 22). Of the “lessons” of the hexagrams, the same author says: “But why, it may be asked, why should they be conveyed to us by such an array of lineal figures, and in such a farrago of emblematic representations” (ibid., p. 25). However, we are nowhere told that Legge ever bothered to put the method to a practical test.   2 .

For example, the  invidi  (“the envious:”) are a constantly recurring image in the old Latin books on alchemy, especially in the  Turba philosophorum  (eleventh or twelfth century).   7 . From the Latin  concipere , “to take together,” e.g., in a vessel:  concipere  derives from  capere , “to take,” “to grasp.”   8 . This is the classical etymology. The derivation of  religio  from  religare , “bind to,” originated with the Church Fathers.   9 . I made this experiment before I actually wrote the foreword.   10 . The Chinese interpret only the changing lines in the hexagram obtained by use of the oracle. I have found all the lines of the hexagram to be relevant in most cases.   11 . [Cf. R. Wilhelm and C. G. Jung,  The Secret of the Golden Flower , tr. Cary F. Baynes (London and New York. 1931; new edn., revised, 1962), in which this address appears as an appendix.

His book was published in 1876 under the title,  A Translation of the Confucian YiKing or the Classic of Changes, with Notes and Appendix .   6 . From the discussion here presented, it will become self-evident that the Book of Changes was not a lexicon, as has been assumed in many quarters.   7 . [ Zeichen , meaning sign, is used by Wilhelm to denote the linear figures in the  I Ching , those of three lines as well as those of six lines. The Chinese word for both types of signs is  kua . To avoid ambiguity, the precedent established by Legge ( The Sacred Books of the East , XVI:  The Yi King ) has been adopted throughout: the term “trigram” is used for the sign consisting of three lines, and “hexagram” for the sign consisting of six lines.]   8 .

[Fourth century B.C.]   24 . [All three are Han scholars.]   25 . [A.D. 226-249.]   26 . [A.D. 960-1279.]   27 . [Ch’êng Hao, A.D. 1032-1085.]   28 . [A.D. 1130-1200.]   29 . [A.D. 1662-1722.]   30 . [A number of footnote quotations from German poetry, chiefly passages from Goethe, have been omitted in the English rendering because their poetic suggestiveness disappears in translation.]   1 . The hexagram is assigned to the fourth month, May–June, when the light-giving power is at its zenith, i.e., before the summer solstice has marked the beginning of the year’s decline. [The German text reads “April–May”; this is obviously a slip, for the first month of the Chinese lunar year extends approximately from the beginning of February to the beginning of March. New Year is a variable date, falling around February 5. Two or three other slips of this sort occurring later in the book have been similarly corrected, but without special mention.]   2 . [The German word used here is  fördernd , literally rendered by “furthering.” It occurs again and again as a key word in Wilhelm’s rendering of the Chinese text. To avoid extreme awkwardness, the phrase “is favorable” is occasionally used as an alternative.]   3 . [This quotation and those following are from commentary material on this hexagram appearing in  bk. III . It will be noted here, as well as in a number of other instances, that the wording of the passages is not identical in the two books.]   4 . Cf. Gen. 2:1 ff., where the development of the different creatures is also attributed to the fall of rain.   5 . [“Mores” is the word chosen to render the German word  Sitte , when the latter refers, as in the present instance, to what the Chinese know as  li . However, neither “mores” nor any other available English word, such as “manners” or “customs,” conveys an adequate idea of what  li  stood for in ancient China, because none of them necessarily denotes anything more than behavior growing out of and regulated by tradition. The ideas for which  li  stands seem to have had their origin in a religious attitude to life and in ethical principles developing out of that attitude. On the religious side  li  meant the observance with true piety of the ritual through which the “will of heaven” was interpreted and made to prevail on earth. On the moral side it meant the sense of propriety—understood to be innate in man—that, through training, makes possible right relationships in personal life and in society.  Li  was the cornerstone upon which Confucius built in his effort to bring order out of chaos in his era (see  The Sacred Books of the East , XXVII:  The Li Ki ). Obedience to the code of  li  was entirely self-imposed as regards the “superior man,” who in feudal times was always a man of rank. The conduct of the “inferior man”—the lower-class individual—was governed by law.]   6 . [See  here . The text of the  Wên Yen  (Commentary on the Words of the Text) appears in  bk. III .]   7 . The Creative causes the beginning and begetting of all beings, and can therefore be designated as heaven, radiant energy, father, ruler. It is a question whether the Chinese personified the Creative, as the Greeks conceived it in Zeus. The answer is that this problem is not the main one for the Chinese. The divine-creative principle is suprapersonal and makes itself perceptible only through its all-powerful activity. It has, to be sure, an external aspect, which is heaven, and heaven, like all that lives, has a spiritual consciousness, God, the Supreme Ruler. But all this is summed up as the Creative.   8 . The lines are counted from the bottom up, i.e., the lowest is taken as the first. If the person consulting the oracle draws a seven, this is important in relation to the structure of the hexagram as a whole, because it is a strong line, but inasmuch as it does not move [change] it has no meaning as an individual line. On the other hand, if the questioner draws a nine, the line is a moving one, and a special meaning is attached to it; this must be considered separately. The same principle applies in respect to all the other strong lines [and also as regards moving and nonmoving weak lines, i.e., sixes and eights]. The two lowest lines in each hexagram stand for the earth, the two in the middle for the world of man, and the upper two for heaven. [Further details as to the meaning of the nines and sixes are given  here .]   9 . [The upper trigram is considered to be “outside,” the lower “inside” (see  here ). This distinction underlies the constant juxtaposition, to be observed throughout bks.  I  and  III , of inner, mental states and external actions or events, of subjective and objective experiences. From this also arise the frequent comparisons between ability and position, form and content, outer adornment and inner worth.]   10 . [The circle indicates that this line is a governing ruler of the hexagram. Constituting rulers are marked by a square. For explanation of governing and constituting rulers, see  here .]   1 . [Hexagrams that are opposites in structure are not necessarily opposites in meaning.]   2 . [See  here , sec. 2.]   3 . While the top line of THE CREATIVE indicates titanic pride and forms a parallel to the Greek legend of Icarus, the top line of THE RECEPTIVE presents a parallel to the myth of Lucifer’s rebellion against God, or to the battle between the powers of darkness and the gods of Valhalla, which ended with the Twilight of the Gods.   1 . A different translation is possible here, which would result in a different interpretation:   Difficulties pile up.   Horse and wagon turn about.   If the robber were not there,   The wooer would come.   The maiden is faithful, she does not pledge herself.   Ten years—then she pledges herself.     1 . [“Fool” and “folly” as used in this hexagram should be understood to mean the immaturity of youth and its consequent lack of wisdom, rather than mere stupidity. Parsifal is known as the “pure fool” not because he was dull-witted but because he was inexperienced.]   1 . [In the German translation, this secondary name does not appear in  bk. I . See  here .]   2 . [The upper trigram is considered to be in front of the lower. See  here .]   1 . [See  here .]   2 . [See  here  for an explanation of what is meant by the “time.”]   1 . [ Auftreten , the German word used for the name of the hexagram, means both “treading” and “conduct.”]   2 . [See explanation of this line in  bk. III ,  here .]   1 . [This refers to Ch’êng T’ang, the first of the Shang rulers, whose reign is thought to have begun in 1766 B.C. However, modern Chinese scholarship no longer accepts the identification of the Emperor I (1191–1155 B.C., according to tradition) with T’ang, and holds that the daughter mentioned was given to King Wên’s father, or perhaps to King Wên himself.]   1 . The meaning of this hexagram parallels the saying of Jesus: “Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.”   2 . It might be supposed that HOLDING TOGETHER ( 8 ) would be a more favorable hexagram than POSSESSION IN GREAT MEASURE, because in the former one strong individual gathers five weak ones around him. But the judgment added in the present hexagram, “Supreme success,” is much the more favorable. The reason is that in the eighth hexagram the men held together by the powerful ruler are only simple subordinate persons, while here those who stand as helpers at the side of the mild ruler are strong and able individuals.   3 . This offers the same dictum about possessions as that found in the words of the Bible: “Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it” [Luke 17:33].   4 . Another generally accepted translation of the line is as follows: He does not rely on his abundance. No blame. This would mean that the individual avoids mistakes because he possesses as if he possessed nothing.   1 . This hexagram offers a number of parallels to the teachings of the Old and the New Testament, e.g., “And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted” [Matt. 23:12]; “Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain” [Isa. 40:4]; “God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble” [Jas. 4:6]. The concept of the Last Judgment in the Parsee religion shows similar features. The Greek notion of the jealousy of the gods might be mentioned in connection with the third of the biblical passages here cited.   2 . There are not many hexagrams in the Book of Changes in which all the lines have an exclusively favorable meaning, as in the hexagram of MODESTY. This shows how great a value Chinese wisdom places on this virtue.   1 . Goethe’s attitude after the Napoleonic wars is an example of this in European history.   1 . [See the two trigrams.]   1 . Apart from the meaning of the hexagram as a whole, the single lines are explained as follows: the persons represented by the first and the top line suffer punishment, the others inflict it (see the corresponding lines in  hexagram 4 , Mêng, YOUTHFUL FOLLY).   2 . It should be noted here that there is an alternative interpretation of this hexagram, based on the idea, “Above, light (the sun); below, movement.” In this interpretation the hexagram symbolizes a market below, full of movement, while the sun is shining in the sky above. The allusion to meat suggests that it is a food market. Gold and arrows are articles of trade. The disappearance of the nose means the vanishing of smell, that is, the person in question is not covetous. The idea of poison points to the dangers of wealth, and so on throughout. Confucius says in regard to the nine at the beginning in this hexagram: “The inferior man is not ashamed of unkindness and does not shrink from injustice. If no advantage beckons he makes no effort. If he is not intimidated he does not improve himself, but if he is made to behave correctly in small matters he is careful in large ones. This is fortunate for the inferior man.” On the subject of the nine at the top Confucius says: “If good does not accumulate, it is not enough to make a name for a man. If evil does not accumulate, it is not strong enough to destroy a man. Therefore the inferior man thinks to himself, ‘Goodness in small things has no value,’ and so neglects it. He thinks, ‘Small sins do no harm,’ and so does not give them up. Thus his sins accumulate until they can no longer be covered up, and his guilt becomes so great that it can no longer be wiped out.”   1 . This hexagram shows tranquil beauty—clarity within, quiet without. This is the tranquillity of pure contemplation. When desire is silenced and the will comes to rest, the world-as-idea becomes manifest. In this aspect the world is beautiful and removed from the struggle for existence. This is the world of art. However, contemplation alone will not put the will to rest absolutely. It will awaken again, and then all the beauty of form will appear to have been only a brief moment of exaltation. Hence this is still not the true way of redemption. For this reason Confucius felt very uncomfortable when once, on consulting the oracle, he obtained the hexagram of GRACE.   1 . Book of Mencius, bk. VI, sec. A, 14. [Mencius lived from 389 to 305 B.C.]   2 . [See  here , sec. 5.]   1 . The usual translation, “two bowls of rice,” has been corrected on the basis of Chinese commentaries.   1 . It is a noteworthy and curious coincidence that fire and care of the cow are connected here just as in the Parsee religion. [According to the Parsee belief the Divine Light, or Fire, was manifested in the mineral, vegetable, and animal worlds before it appeared in human form. Its animal incarnation was the cow, and Ahura-Mazda was nourished on her milk.]   1 . The idea expressed by this hexagram is similar to that in the saying of Jesus: “But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil” (Matt. 5:39).   2 . A similar idea is suggested in the story of Jacob’s battle with the angel of Peniel: “I will not let thee go, except thou bless me” (Gen. 32:26).   1 . This is the theme dealt with in detail in the Great Learning,  Ta Hsüeh  [ The Chinese Classics, I: Confucian Analects , etc., tr. James Legge, 2nd edn., Oxford, 1893, pp. 355–81].   1 . Cutting off of the hair and nose was a severe and degrading punishment.   1 . [The present hexagram and the following one, INCREASE, are regarded as formed by changes in T’ai, PEACE ( 11 ), and P’i, STANDSTILL ( 12 ), respectively. See  here .]   2 . Cf. the story of the widow’s mite in the Gospel of Luke.   1 . [Literally, “exhausted.”]   1 . Cf. Goethe’s tale, “Das Märchen,” in which the phrase, “The hour has come!” is repeated three times before the great transformation begins.   1 . [There are beautiful examples of the  ting  in most of our museums, where they are classified as ritual vessels. The German word used by Wilhelm for  ting  is  Tiegel , meaning literally “caldron” and, in another sense, “crucible.” Since this characteristic Chinese vessel is unique in form, so different from either a caldron or a crucible in the usual sense, the word  ting  has been retained wherever feasible here.]   2 . Cf. the other three hexagrams dealing with nourishment, viz., hexagrams  5 ,  27 ,  48 .   1 . In China, monogamy is formally the rule, and every man has but one official wife. This marriage, which is less the concern of the two participants than of their families, is contracted with strict observance of forms. But the husband retains the right also to indulge his more personal inclinations. Indeed, it is the most gracious duty of a good wife to be helpful to him in this respect. In this way the relationship that develops becomes a beautiful and open one, and the girl who enters the family at the husband’s wish subordinates herself modestly to the wife as a younger sister. Of course it is a most difficult and delicate matter, requiring tact on the part of all concerned. But under favorable circumstances this represents the solution of a problem for which European culture has failed to find an answer. Needless to say, the ideal set for woman in China is achieved no oftener than is the European ideal.   1 . [Literally, “perseverance.”]   1 . [Literally, in the German, “He dissolves himself from his group.”]   1 . [See  here .]   1 . [Wu Ting reigned from 1324 to 1266 B.C.]   1 . [See  here .]   2 . Note how this situation differs from that in the first line of the preceding hexagram.   1 . [See  bk. III , under the individual hexagrams.]   2 . James Legge stresses the opinion that a real understanding of the  I Ching  becomes possible only when the commentary material is separated from the text ( The Sacred Books of the East , XVI:  The Yi King , 2nd edn., Oxford, 1899). Accordingly he carefully separates the ancient commentaries from the text, and then supplies with it the commentaries of the Sung period [A.D. 960-1279]. Legge does not say why he holds the Sung period to be more closely related to the original text than Confucius [551-479 B.C.]. What he does is to follow with meticulous literalness the edition called  Chou I Che Chung , belonging to the K’ang Hsi period [1662-1722], which I also have used. The rendering is very inferior to Legge’s other translations. For example, he does not take the trouble to translate the names of the hexagrams—a task of course not easy but by so much the more necessary. In other respects also, definite misconceptions occur.   3 . [Bks.  I ,  III , under the individual hexagrams: passages entitled “The Image.”]   4 . [See  here , n. 22.]   5 .

This commentary moreover places the origin of the Book of Changes in “middle antiquity.” This term belongs to an arrangement of historical periods according to which the epoch of the Spring and Autumn Annals [ Ch’un Ch’iu , a chronological list of events that occurred in the state of Lu between 722 and 481 B.C., edited by Confucius], which closes with Confucius, is called “later antiquity.” It is obvious that this arrangement of periods could not have been utilized by Confucius himself.   12 .

[Literally, “Before-the-World Sequence.”]   1 . These passages represent variants on the text of the  I Ching , in which the Creative is symbolized by the dragon, the Receptive by the mare, and the Clinging by the cow.   2 . In the text of the  I Ching , the color of the Receptive is yellow, and its animal is the mare.   3 . [That is, pierced with holes.]   1 . [Fifth Wing, Sixth Wing. Passages of this commentary are to be found repeated in  bk. III , as “Appended Judgments.”]   2 . [ Umwandeln, verwandeln : later on in his explanation Wilhelm defines  umwandeln  as meaning, in this connection, recurrent change, and  verwandeln  as meaning change in which there is no return to the starting point. The words “cyclic” and “sequent” are therefore introduced here in anticipation of these definitions, as the types of change alluded to would not otherwise be intelligible.]   3 . Here the principles of the Creative and the Receptive, and the Greek principles of  logos  and  eros , are in close approximation.   1 . It is to be noted that the designations yang and yin, later so much used, are not the terms chosen here. This is an indication of the antiquity of the text.   1 . [Cf. Wilhelm and Jung,  The Secret of the Golden Flower  (1962 edn.), p. 14.]   1 . Tao ( SINN ) is something that sets in motion and maintains the interplay of these forces. As this something means only a direction, invisible and in no way material, the Chinese chose for it the borrowed word tao, meaning “way,” “course,” which is also nothing in itself, yet serves to regulate all movements. For a discussion of the translation of the word tao, see the introduction to my translation of Lao-tse. [See  here , n. 13.]   2 . This shows again to what extent the point of view of the Book of Changes is based on the principles of the organic world, in which there is no entropy.   3 . This is probably the passage on which Mencius based his doctrine that man’s nature is good.   4 . Cf. R. Wilhelm,  Chinesische Lebensweisheit  (Darmstadt, 1922), pp. 16 ff.   1 .

IV of the  Shu Ching , as translated by Legge ( The Sacred Books of the East , III:  The Shu King , Oxford, 1879).]   2 . The Chinese year is in essential agreement with the Metonic year. [Meton, an Athenian astronomer of the fifth century B.C., used the phases of the moon as the basis of his calculations.]   1 . [A.D. 1130–1200.]   2 . The way in which the Book of Changes works can best be compared to an electrical circuit reaching into all situations. The circuit only affords the potentiality of lighting; it does not give light. But when contact with a definite situation is established through the questioner, the “current” is activated, and the given situation is illumined. Although this analogy is not used in any of the commentaries, it serves to explain in a few words the entire meaning of the text.   1 . [Like Fu Hsi, one of the legendary rulers of China. He is credited with having founded the first dynasty of China, the Hsia dynasty, said to have lasted from 2205 to 1766 B.C.]   2 . This seems to refer to a train of thought the traces of which are scattered through  chapter VIII  and the present chapter. The problem is whether, in view of the inadequacy of our means of understanding, a contact transcending the limits of time is possible—whether a later epoch is ever able to understand an earlier one. On the basis of the Book of Changes, the answer is in the affirmative. True enough, speech and writing are imperfect transmitters of thought, but by means of the images—we would say “ideas”—and the stimuli contained in them, a spiritual force is set in motion whose action transcends the limits of time. And when it comes upon the right man, one who has inner relationship with this tao, it can forthwith be taken up by him and awakened anew to life. This is the concept of the supranatural connection between the elect of all the ages.   1 . The reading “kindness” instead of “men” is contradicted by the context.   1 .

The rest of the commentary, which explains the line judgments—though called Small Images (see  here )—appears in the passages designated  b  under the heading “The Lines.” The passages designated  a  repeat the line judgments of  bk. I . The German edition omits this repetition in the treatment of the first two hexagrams. However, the presence of the line itself makes the commentary so much more intelligible that it has seemed desirable here to supply the omission. Under “Six in the third place” in K’un, a parenthetic completion of the line text under  b , and a sentence in the comment explaining this interpolation—both supplied by Wilhelm for elucidation in the absence of  a —have been omitted as superfluous.]   6 . [ Wên Yen : Seventh Wing.]   7 . [In the German rendering, these correlations are stated in four sentences so printed that they appear as a passage from the  Wên Yen .

In the text, the character for “leads” is written  tu ; which means “to poison,” but should be read  tan , “to lead.”   2 . The word  lü , “order,” in its original sense means a reedlike musical instrument. The literal meaning would be: “The army marches forth to the sound of horns. If the horns are not in tune, it is a bad sign.”   3 . The sentence  li chih yen  is best translated by taking the word  yen  (meaning “to speak,” “to explain”) simply as the equivalent of an exclamation point, which it frequently is in the Book of Odes. This yields the translation, “It furthers one to hold fast, to catch” (the game).   1 . [See  here .]    2 . [See  here .]   1 . [From  chap. VII  of the  Great Commentary : Fifth Wing, Sixth Wing.
